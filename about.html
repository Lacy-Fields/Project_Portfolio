      <h2>A Bit About Us!</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Pleasure to meet you! We are a just a couple of humans just like everyone else, really! My better half is a brilliant RN, and I am a CS Major! Together we run on coffee, anyway you make it! Through this website, we hope to help inform others who are interested in learning more about the Sphynx breed, while using the platform to sharpen my own Div Slinging skills!</p>
      <p>Our journey with these cool cats began in 2020, when toilet paper was scarce, and DoorDash was king. My other half settled on bringing home a wrinkled chicken of our own, and so the research began. We had both seen the Sphynx before through various Apps, TV, etc. but really knew nothing about them otherwise. We scoured Google and combed through so many sites before we found someone we trusted to help us make sure this was the leap to take. And so, after much patience and learning the most we could, in August 2020 we welcomed a set of siblings to our home!</p>
      <p>Life hasn't been the same since then and we wouldn't have it any other way. Our dynamic duo, while brother and sister, couldn't be any more different in their personalities and always keep us on our toes. Through a lot of trial and error, we found what works best for all of us when it comes to their unique grooming needs, diet, socializing, and so much more! We've even been to the beach! Have you ever seen a cat print in the sand? Didn't think so!</p>
